/**
 * RequireConsultingMember — wraps protected consulting routes.
 *
 * CRM access is granted ONLY when the user has an approved agency
 * application (checked via has_approved_agency_application RPC).
 * The old subscription/payment gate has been removed — approval
 * is the sole authorization mechanism for CRM access.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   - Guests → /auth (with redirect back)
 *   - allowOnboarding routes (workspace, apply, application-status) → always render
 *   - No approved application → /consulting/workspace (shows application gate)
 *   - Approved but zero agencies → /consulting/workspace (unless allowNoAgency)
 *   - Approved + has agencies → full CRM access
 *
 * The `allowExpired` prop is kept for backward compatibility but no longer
 * affects access (subscription gate removed).
